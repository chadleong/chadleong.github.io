As I embrace fatherhood and settle back in Malaysia after years in the US and Norway, I find myself in a space of deep reflection about what truly matters in this rapidly shifting world. 2025 is not just another year—it’s a time when personal milestones intertwine with the global forces that shape our collective future.

Every day, I witness the subtle yet profound influence of artificial intelligence. AI is no longer just a technical marvel confined to research labs or futuristic movies; it has become a living part of our daily existence, quietly reshaping how we work, learn, and interact. The promise of AI to unlock new realms of creativity and efficiency is as exhilarating as it is daunting, urging us to rethink not only our jobs but the very ethical foundations on which progress is built.

Yet, as technology forges ahead, the world continues to wrestle with the age-old specter of conflict. The undercurrents of war and unrest remind us that despite our digital advancements, humanity remains vulnerable to old divisions and new tensions. It’s a paradox where the digital era, with its borderless exchange of ideas, exists alongside very real struggles for peace and security. This collision of progress and peril brings a constant, if uneasy, reminder that innovation and conflict often dance on the edge of each other.

The ripple effects extend into the realm of finance and the economy, where traditional models are rapidly evolving. We are living through a time when digital currencies, market volatility, and shifting fiscal policies have made the financial landscape as unpredictable as it is dynamic. Every economic decision, from the smallest saving to large-scale investments, is now a reflection of a broader narrative—a narrative that grapples with uncertainty while chasing the promise of stability and growth.

In the midst of all these external shifts, my personal journey of reconnection with family and heritage serves as a grounding force. It reminds me that while technology, geopolitics, and economics may redefine the backdrop of our lives, the essence of our existence lies in the human connections we forge and the values we hold dear. In a world brimming with both opportunities and challenges, the act of reflecting, of finding meaning in each moment, becomes an essential guidepost for navigating the complexities of modern life.

2025 challenges us to reconcile progress with purpose, to balance the cutting edge of innovation with the timeless need for compassion and understanding. And as I write these words, I am filled with a quiet resolve to nurture this balance, cherishing the personal amidst the global, and striving to create a future where every breakthrough serves the deeper, enduring quest for meaning.

c'est la vie
