This is a rude awakening on society.

One would think that war would be far behind us by now and we as humanity should aim for advancing the society as a whole.

This is neither a war nor a war of the people but more like the culmination of the ego of 1 man and his pure will for manifestation.

It is hard to imagine that all these could be happening in the year of 2022.

One wonders what could be the end game and how do we deal with it as a world citizen.

I shudder to think of the future and all I could do for now is I pray for the best.
